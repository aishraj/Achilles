## Things to be done 

- The API should accept a file or a string. Use JSoup to validate the file or the string.

-  For converting HTML items like tables, classes, images or divs, take a look at how MarkDown generates these. Reverse engineering the maximum possible functionality is our goal.

- Workplan is : HTML File => Cleaned up representation with known tags => Intermediate representation => Markdown file.

Step 2 and 3 shall be done with the help of  JSoup.
